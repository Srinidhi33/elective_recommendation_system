# Elective Course Recommendation System

## Overview

This project provides an interactive system to recommend elective courses to students based on their past performance and preferences. The system allows students to view course recommendations, check course details, and enroll in courses directly via a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The backend leverages SQLite for enrollment management and a machine learning-based recommendation model to suggest relevant courses.
